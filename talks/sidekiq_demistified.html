# Sidekiq demistified

### Nikica JokiÄ‡

class: spacedout

## What even is Sidekiq

--

- efficient background job processing for Rails

???

[this](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/master/lib/sidekiq.rb#L40-L42)

why do we need bg jobs

--

- built using magic of threads

???

resque vs sidekiq (processes vs threads)

--

- doesn't hammer the primary DB with unnecesary queries

???

## Sidkiq leans on Redis<span class="red">*</span>

<div class="footnotes">
	<div class="first"><sup class="red">*</sup> which by itself is many kinds of awesome</div>
</div>

--

- NoSQL : in memory key-value store

???

yay? nosql : no relations and tables


http://engineering.wayfair.com/2013/04/devnull-vs-mongodb-benchmark-bake-off/

--

- can [really persist](http://redis.io/topics/persistence) data (via RDB/AOF)

--

- a ["data structure store"](http://redis.io/topics/data-types)

???

it's not a document store (although it can be), it focuses on data structures

--


- useful if you want to push state out of your system

???

example: web scarper - SETEX - you want to remember what urls you already visited but want to visit them again in the future


---

class: spacedout

## Sidekiq uses TODO lists

--

- queues jobs by leaning on Redis [lists](http://redis.io/commands/lpush)

???

doubly linked list, efficient push/pop operations on both the left and right sides

you can use them both like a FIFO/queue or FILO/stack data structure

--

- what does [perform_later](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/v4.0.1/lib/sidekiq/worker.rb#L53-L55) do?

--

- who actually [does the work](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/v4.0.1/lib/sidekiq/launcher.rb#L16-L27) ?

---

## Sidekiq uses a calendar?

--

- schedules jobs by leaning on Redis [sorted sets](http://redis.io/commands/ZADD)

--

- [perform_in](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/v4.0.1/lib/sidekiq/worker.rb#L57-L69) is just syntax sugar

--

- how does Sidekiq know [when to execute a job](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/v4.0.1/lib/sidekiq/scheduled.rb#L61-L71) ?
