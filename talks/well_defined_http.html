# Well-defined HTTP

## Nikica Jokić

---

# HTTP is deceptively simple

???

looks simple in a browser or from a framework, but …

--

* simple syntax, semantics up to you
???
the rfc defines what the protocol looks like, not what it's entities mean

--

* easy to build crappy, bad-behaving APIs
???
everyone takes this to mean they can make up their own meaning about constituent parts of the protocol

--

* do you?

--

	- use error status codes
???

respond with 200 and then say it's an error in the body

most people handle only a few (200, 401, 404 and 500). how about 201 (created), 301 and 307 (moved), 406 (not-acceptable)? how do you decide if it was a client (4xx) or a server (5xx) error?

--

	- respect content-types (accept headers)

???

most APIs respond with a single content-type, irregardless of what you requested (in the accept header)

--

	- handle resource migration and locations

???

resource moved? gone?

### Aside: 3-way handshake as a state machine

???

we take think of the protocol as just three steps, but there is a state machine describing the details (because as always, the devil is in the details).

# Webmachine

Declarative, instead of:


```ruby
get '/hello/:name' do
  "Hello #{params[:name]}!"
end
```

--

You do:

```ruby
def resource_exists?
  resource
end
```

???

declarative: you don’t define what the verbs do (GETs, PUTs, POSTs and DELETEs)


---

# Webmachine

Works by describing facts about the resource:

--
	
* known-method? / method-allowed ? 

--

* known-media-type? / media-type-available?

--

* allowed? / authorised?

--

* exists? / existed?

--

* moved-temporarily? / moved-permanently?	

???

there are many more, but these questions are domain specific
