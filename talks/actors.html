# Celluloid, Actors in Ruby

## Nikica JokiÄ‡

---

# What's an (Erlang) actor?

--

* A high level concurrency abstraction

--

	- thread:actor != 1:1

--

* concurrent objects/processes, exist and are run independently

--

	- they [share nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_nothing_architecture), everyting is communicated by messages
	
--

	- state is implicit (in method arguments and messages)

--

* "Let it crash"

--

	- linking/monitoring

--

	- supervisors

--

	- supervision groups

--

* [concurrency is not parallelism](http://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism)

---

# Cell = Ruby actor

--

* objects that run concurrentlty 

--

	- hold state in instance variables

--

	- variables are mutable in Ruby

--

* internals

--

	- each object has its own thread

--

	- each message (method) runs inside a fiber (you can suspend/resume them)

--

* error handling 

--

	- linking and monitoring
	
--

	- no supervision trees for now
