# Rust and memory safety

### Nikica Jokić

class: center, middle

## Why did I choose Rust?

???

wanted to write my own interpreter/compiler, but was afraid of memory managementa i segfaults :)

---

### Dangling pointers

```rust
void example() {
	vector<string> v;
	
	auto& elem = v[0];
	v.push_back("some string"); // may allocate new memory 
								// and copy the old contents
	
	// elem is now pointing to freed memory
	
	cout << elem; // crashes!
}

```
---

### Iterator invalidation

```rust
for(iterator it = array.begin(); it != array.end(); ++it) {
    array.erase(it->first);

    // whoops, now map has been restructured and
	// iterator still thinks itself is healthy
}
```

---

### There's lot of these ...

* Array bounds errors:
    - Buffer overflow 
    - Buffer over-read 
* Dynamic memory errors 
    - Dangling pointer 
    - Double free 
    - Invalid free 
    - Null pointer accesses 
* Uninitialized variables 
    - Wild pointers 
* Out-of-memory errors 
    - Stack exhaustion 
    - Heap exhaustion

---


### Aliasing + Mutation <small>(is the root of all evil)</small>

Root cause of all problems related memory safety.

--

* aliasing - multiple refs to the same memory location

--

* mutation - changing the ref itself or ref'd data

--

**There is a ‘data race’ when two or more pointers access the same memory location at the same time, where at least one of them is writing, and the operations are not synchronized.**

---

### Historic overview - C

* completely manual heap management - `malloc()` + `free()`

--
* `malloc()` returns `void*` - explicit casting required

--
* many undefined behavious
	* uninitialized variables
	* signed `int` overflow
	* oversized shift amounts
	* dereferencing a NULL pointer

---

### Historic overview - C++

* `new` + `delete`

--
* `new T` returns reference to `T`

--
* objects on the stack are deleted when they go out of scope
	*  object's destructor is called when the object goes out of scope

--
* objects on the heap must be deleted manually

--
* have to manually enforce good memory managemeny practices (RAII)
	* keep objects on the stack and their resources on the heap
	* delete resources in the destructor

--
* there are smarter memory management options (also not enforced)
	* `unique_ptr` (owned pointer)
	* `shared_pointer` (shared pointer)

---

### Java, Python, Ruby, Go ...

* `new` + GC

--
* no control over memory
	* almost everything a reference
	* almost all data is stored on the heap

--
* speed improvements happen in the VM/GC

---

### Rust, core concepts

* ownership (incl. move semantics)
* borrowing
	* shared / immutable
	* singular / mutable
* lifetimes

--

All of those combined prevent "data races".

---

### Ownership / move semantics

* varibale bindings 'have ownership' of what they’re bound to

--
* move: I give something to someone (a pointer is copied)

--
* implies mutation, but there's NO ALIASING ('something' is not mine any more)

--

```rust
fn main() {
    let v = vec![1, 2, 3]; // v owns the vector

	let v2 = v; // ownership is moved to 'v2' (copies the pointer)

	println!("v[0] is: {}", v[0]); // Error: use of moved value: 'v'
}
```
---

### Ownership / move semantics

* varibale bindings 'have ownership' of what they’re bound to
* move: I give something to someone (a pointer is copied)
* implies mutation, but there's NO ALIASING ('something' is not mine any more)

```rust
fn give() {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	vec.push(1);
	vec.push(2);
	take(vec);
}

fn take(vec: Vec<int>) {
	// do something with the vector
}
```

---

### Ownership / move semantics

* varibale bindings 'have ownership' of what they’re bound to
* move: I give something to someone (a pointer is copied)
* implies mutation, but there's NO ALIASING ('something' is not mine any more)

```rust
fn give() {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	vec.push(1);
	vec.push(2);
	take(vec);
	vec.push(3) // Error: vec has been moved
				// Prevents: use after free, double move
}

fn take(vec: Vec<int>) {
	// do something with the vector
}
```


---

### Shared borrow

* immutable share: I share a (read-only) reference to something with one or many interested parties

--
* implies aliasing, there's NO MUTATION

--

```rust
fn lender() {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	vec.push(1);
	vec.push(2);
	use(&vec);
}

fn use(vec: &Vec<int>) {
	// vec is only borrowed here
}
```

---

### Shared borrow

* immutable share: I share a (read-only) reference to something with one or many interested parties
* implies aliasing, there's NO MUTATION

```rust
fn lender() {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	vec.push(1);
	vec.push(2);
	use(&vec);
}

fn use(vec: &Vec<int>) {
	// reading is ok, but..
	vec.push(3); // Error: can't mutate shared reference
}
```

---

### Mutable borrow

* mutable share: I share a (mutable) reference with one and only one interested party

--
* implies mutation, still NO ALIASING

--

```rust
fn push_all(from: &Vec<int>, to: &mut Vec<int>) {
	for elem in from.iter() {
		to.push(*elem);
	}
}

``` 

---

### Mutable borrow

* mutable share: I share a (mutable) reference with one and only one interested party
* implies mutation, still NO ALIASING

```rust
fn push_all(from: &Vec<int>, to: &mut Vec<int>) {
	for elem in from.iter() {
		to.push(*elem);
	}
}

fn caller() {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	let mut vec2 = Vec::new();

	push_all(&vec, &mut vec); // Error: can't have both shared
							  // and mutable ref at the same time

	push_all(&vec, &mut vec2); // cool, only one mutable reference
}
``` 

---

### Lifetimes

* references have their implicit or explicit lifetimes

--
* references cannot outlive the thing they're referencing

--

```rust
fn so_many_lifetimes() {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	
	for i in range(0, vec.len()) { // lifetame of elem
		let elem = &vec[i];
		vec.push(...); // Error: vec is borrowed
	}
	
	vec.push(); // you're good brah
}
```

---

### Lifetimes

* references have their implicit or explicit lifetimes
* references cannot outlive the thing they're referencing

```rust
fn lifetime_in_fn() -> &int {
	let mut vec = Vec::new();
	//...
	let elem = &vec[0]; // borrowed here
	return elem; // Error: elem can outlive vec
}
```

---

### Other stuff <small>(I don't yet understand)</small>

* `Rc<T>` - reference counted pointer (runtime cost)

--
* `Cell<T>` and `RefCell<T>` - interior mutability

--
* `Arc<T>` - atomically reference counted pointer (thread-safe shared data)

--
* `Mutex<T>` and `RwLock<T>` - mutually exclusive and read/write locked data (thread-safe exclusive data)
