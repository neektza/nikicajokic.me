<article class='about'>

<p>I'm a software developer and a programming languages enthusiast. Apart from coding, I sleep, eat and do martial arts.</p>

<p>This is the page where stuff that peaks my curiosity will end up. Knowing myself, that stuff will probably be computer science related but, from time to time, other topics may creep in.</p>

<p>If you want to know more or contact me, you can look me up on one of the social networks listed below.</p>

<p>Or, you could email me at <code><i>my_twitter_handle</i> @ gmail</code></p>
