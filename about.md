description: "A short note about myself"

My name is Nikica and I'm a software guy, a PLT enthusiast and a martial artist.

This is the page where stuff that peaks my curiosity will end up. Knowing myself, that stuff will probably be related to my fore-mentioned interests, but other topics may creep in.

If you want to know more, you can look me up on various social networks (links below).

Also, you can email me at \{\{ my_twitter_handle }} @ gmail.com
