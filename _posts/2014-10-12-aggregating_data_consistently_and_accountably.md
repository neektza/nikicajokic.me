A couple of days ago I presented in front of a large audience for the first time. I gave a talk about using **event sourcing** techniques in Ruby.

In contrast to the first talk I held (at a local meetup), I prepared **a lot** this time, and it paid off. Since I consider myself to be a nervous person, this was a personal milestone for me. It convinced me that public speaking is just a skill, as any other skill, that can be perfected through practice. While charisma plays a part in any interpersonal interaction, public speaking included, **practicing and actually talking in front of people works towards increasing that charisma and breaking barriers in expressing yourself**.

While preparing for this talk I used the excellent [Presentation Patterns](http://presentationpatterns.com/) book, so I would recommend it to anyone planning on holding one.
